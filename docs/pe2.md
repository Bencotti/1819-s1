## Special Restrictions

- You will be issued a special account on the PE day to solve the exam questions.  

- There will be no Internet access.

## Vim Configuration

Your default account will have the same `.vimrc` as `~cs1010/.vimrc` on the CS1010 PE hosts.  

You are free to edit this during the practical exams.  

You, however, will not be able to download nor install `vim` plugins.

## General Advice

- Save your program regularly.  We will use setup every account with `~/.vimrc` copied from `~cs1010/.vimrc`.  Thus, you can find the last saved version of your files under `~/.backup` if you accidentally deleted your code.
- Plan your time properly.  Do not spend excessive time on any task.  Read through all questions and solved those that you are confident to solve first.
- There are five questions, from very easy to very hard.  Solve as many as you can.  I expect most students will be able to solve 3 out of the 5 questions within the time limit.
- {++Pay attention to the marking criteria, which differs from question to question. ++} 
- Don't start typing your code right away.  Think about the solution first -- what variables are needed?  what is the control flow (using branches and loops)?  Draw out the flowchart if it helps.  
- Break down the problem into smaller ones if the problem is too complex to solve.
- You are not allowed to start typing on the computer for the first 10 minutes of the practical exam, or until the invigilator announced that you can do so.
- You will be given a question form to ask questions to clarify doubts about the question paper.  But note that you can only ask a boolean question (YES/NO answer).
- Just like the assignments, you are not given all the test cases that we will be using during grading.  Please test your code against additional test cases, especially for boundary cases.
