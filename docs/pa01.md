# Programming Assignment 1

## Question 1: Freezer

(a)

Write a program `freezer1.c` that estimates the temperature (in degree Celsius) in a freezer given the elapsed time (in hours) since a power failure.

Assume this temperature $T$ is given by[^1]:

\[
T = \frac{4t^2}{t + 2} - 20;
\]

where $t$ is the time (in hours) since the power failure.

Your program reads in an integer: the number of hours since the start of the power failure.
Call your executable `freezer1`.

### Sample run:
```bash
ooiwt@pe111$ freezer1 
0
-20.0000
ooiwt@pe111$ freezer1 
1
-18.6667
```

(b)
`freezer1` is rather restrictive, as we can only calculate the temperature after one hour, two hours, etc.  The equation given above works for fractional hours as well.  Modify your program, call it `freezer2.c`, so that it now reads in two integers: the number of hours and the number of additional minutes since the start of the power failure.  For example, to calculate the temperature after 2 hours and 45 minutes of power failure:

```bash
ooiwt@pe111$ freezer2
2 45
-13.6316
```

## Question 2: Invest

If you invest $m$ dollars at $r$% interest rate compounded annually, after $n$ years, your investment will grow to $\frac{m ( 1 - (r/100)^{n+1}}{1 - r/100}$ dollars.

Write a program `invest.c` that accepts three integers input: principal $m$, rate $r$, and number of years $n$, and computes the amount of money earned after $n$ years.

You may assume that $r \le 100$.

### Sample Run
```bash
ooiwt@pe111$ invest
100 10 5
111.1110
ooiwt@pe111$ invest
20000 5 10
21052.6316
```

## Question 3: Box

Write a program `box.c` that reads three positive integers representing the length, width, and height of a box, and output (i) its surface area, and (ii) the length of the diagonal between two vertices of the box that are furthest apart (see figure).

You may assume that the surface area of the box does not exceed the maximum value representable in the `long` data type.

You should break down the problem into smaller ones:

- Write a new method `area_of_rectangle` that computes the area of a rectangle given the width and height of the rectangle, then use it to compute the surface area.
- Modify the method `hypotenuse_of` seen in Unit 5 to compute the diagonal of the box.  (hint: pay attention to the type of the parameter and the return value).

### Sample Run
```bash
ooiwt@pe111:~$ box 
12 3 10
372 15.9060
ooiwt@pe111:~$ box 
10 20 30
2200 37.4166

[^1]: I do not know where this formula comes from or if it is correct.  Please ignore the fact that, according to this formula, 32 hours after the power is turned off, the freezer will reach the boiling point of 100 celcius!
