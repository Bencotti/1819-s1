# CS1010 Programming Environment

C is a common programming language and you can find different implementation of C compilers on many platforms.  Wikipedia [lists 42 different C compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C_compilers).  These different compilers supports different processor architecture, operating system, may behave slightly differently, and may support different features of C standards.  It is therefore important for CS1010 to stick to a single platform and single compiler.

Our platform of choice is **Ubuntu 16.04 (or later)** using the `clang` compiler (**version 3.4.2 or later**).

The school has provided a list of computing servers for you to use.  You can access them remotely via `ssh`, or secure shell.  The hosts are:


While it is possible for you to complete the programming assignments on your own computers, the practical exams are done in a control environment using the desktop PCs in the programming labs.  It is therefore advisable for you to familiarize with accessing remote computing servers via `ssh` and edit your program with either `vim` or `macro`.
