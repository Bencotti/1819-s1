## Notes and Lectures :fa-commenting:

### Lecture 4

- [Slides](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt/cs1010/1819s1/slides/cs1010-lec4.pdf) | [Screencast](https://vimeo.com/288496827) | [Kahoot Quiz](kahoot01.md)

In this lecture, we learned how to write programs that involve branching execution paths, using `if`-`else` statements and logical expressions.  [Unit 8 If-Else](08-if-else.md), [Unit 9 Logical Expression](09-logical-exp.md) were covered.

### Lecture 3

- [Slides](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt/cs1010/1819s1/slides/cs1010-lec3.pdf) | [Screencast](https://vimeo.com/287220672)

We covered [Unit 5: First C Program](05-first-c.md), [Unit 6: CS1010 I/O Library](06-cs1010-io.md) and [Unit 7: Arithmetic Operations](07-arithmetic-ops.md).

In this lecture, we got started with writing simple C programs that read inputs, perform some calculations, and display the result.

### Lecture 2

- [Slides](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt/cs1010/1819s1/slides/cs1010-lec2.pdf) | [Screencast](https://vimeo.com/286525343)

We covered [Unit 3: functions](03-func.md) and [Unit 4: types](04-type.md).

In this lecture, we learned the concepts of functions, with which we can build up a more complex algorithm from smaller building blocks, such as finding the maximum.  We also learned about the concept of types.

### Lecture 1

- [Slides](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt/cs1010/1819s1/slides/cs1010-lec1.pdf) | [Screencast](https://vimeo.com/285437711) (password posted on Piazza)

After some admin matters, we introduced what is a program, what is meant by programming, and what is computational problem solving.

We covered [Unit 1: What is a Program?](01-program.md) and [Unit 2: Computational Problems and Algorithms](02-algo.md) in the first lecture.
