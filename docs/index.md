## [Piazza Q&A](https://piazza.com/class/jcaaskvbs754wh) :fa-question-circle: 

Piazza is the Q&A site for students and instructors to ask questions and discuss among each other on all matters related to CS1010.

## Notes and Lectures :fa-commenting:

### Lecture 1

- [Slides](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt/cs1010/1819s1/slides/cs1010-lec1.pdf) 
- [Screencast](https://vimeo.com/285437711) (password posted on Piazza)

After some admin matters, we will introduce what is a program, what is meant by programming, and what is computational problem solving.

We will cover [Unit 1: What is a Program?](01-program.md) and [Unit 2: Computational Problems and Algorithms](02-algo.md) in the first lecture.

### Lecture 2

We will cover [Unit 3: functions](03-func.md) and [Unit 4: types](04-type.md).

In this lecture, we will learn the concepts of functions, with which we can build up a more complex algorithm from smaller building blocks, such as finding the maximum.  We will also learn the concept of types.
