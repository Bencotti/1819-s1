Prefix your email subject with \n[CS1010]\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease use \nPiazza\n for other matters related to the module.  If you email us privately and we feel that your questions/answers are useful to the rest of the class, we will publish it on Piazza, with anonymization when appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Sessions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendance is not compulsory at NUS, but we do take attendance during the tutorial sessions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should stick to your allocated time slot for tutorials.  If there is a strong reason for your to attend another tutorial session, please inform your undergraduate discussion leaders (UDLs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Submissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll programming assignments must be submitted on time.  If you need an extension, please ask for one and provide a justification for approval.  Only academic reasons and compasionate reasons can be considered (e.g., representing NUS for a sports event is OK; Attending a wedding is not)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor late submission, there is a 1% penalty (of the assessment grade) for every 5-minute after the deadline, capped at 80%.  For example, if a homework is deserved 40 marks, and it is submitted 100 minutes after the deadline, the student will get 32 marks instead (20% penalty).  If it is submitted 10 hours after the deadline, the student will get 8 marks (as it has hit the cap of 80% penalty).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussions and Plagiarism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage discussions among students for programming assignments, but each student should be responsible for writing his/her own code and should give credits to others when appropriate.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNUS and School of Computing have a high standard on academic honesty and take any violation seriously.  In the context of computing modules, source code plagiarism -- copying code from another source and attributing it as one's own code -- is a series violation.   Please read the page \nPreventing Plagiarism\n from the school's website to familiarize yourself with the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI adopt a \"no mercy\" policy when it comes to disciplinary action on plagiarism.  Both parties, the student who copied, and the student who allowed others to copy, will be penalized equally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencast will be recorded and posted online 3-4 days after the lecture. \nThis will be done on a 'best effort' basis and screencast will not be guaranteed to be available on time or at all.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosting of screencast is meant to help students who attended the lecture to recap the content, or to help those who are not able to attend the lecture due to unexpected circumstances.  It does not mean that you should skip lecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Solutions and Slides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides will be posted \nafter\n the class.  Note that slides are used as a \nvisual aid\n to assist me during lecture.  It is not meant as summary of lectures nor a replacement of lecture notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a module like CS1010, there is often not a single correct answer.  Hence, there is no model solution for this module.  Sample solutions may be posted (both good and bad ones) for discussion.  I strongly encourage students to discuss your solution with the teaching team, instead of just comparing your solution with the sample solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\n\n\nStudents will received the grades they deserved irrespective of how the other students in the class performed (i.e., no bell curve)\n\n\n\n\nOpen Book Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll assessment, including practical exams, midterm test, and final assessment, are open book assessment -- you can bring in your notes or other \nanalog\n reference materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is \nnothing to memorize\n for this class.",

            "text": "Unit 2: Computational Problems and Algorithms\n\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\n\nAfter this unit, students should:\n\n\n\n\nunderstand the basic terminologies: computational problem solving, algorithm, flowchart, debugging, testing, variables, value, assignment\n\n\nbe familiar with the algorithm to find the maximum among a list of numbers\n\n\nbe able to trace through flowcharts and updates of variables, and argue if a given algorithm is correct or incorrect\n\n\n\n\nComputational Problems\n\n\nSo, what is computational problem solving?  Let's start with the question, what is a \ncomputational problem\n?  \n\n\nA computational problem is a problem that can be solved step-by-step with a computer.  These problems usually have a well-defined input, constraints, and conditions that the output must satisfied.  Here are some types of computational problems:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \ndecision problem\n is one where the answer is yes or no.  For instance, \"given a number \nn\n, is \nn\n even?\" is a decision problem.  Some decision problems take more steps to solve than others.  For instance, \"given a number \nn\n, is \nn\n prime?\" takes more steps than just checking the parity of a number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \nsearch problem\n is one where the solution consists of one or more values that satisfies a given condition.  For instance, we may want to compute a path from one geographical location to another on a map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \ncounting problem\n is one where the answer is the number of solutions to a search problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn \noptimization problem\n is one where the solution is the \"best\" possible solution, where the \"best\" can be defined in a different way.  For instance, we may want to compute the fastest route from one location to another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions such as \"what is the meaning of life?\" \"do I look good in this outfit?\"\n1\n are not computational problems, because they do not have well-defined input, constraints, and conditions that the output must satisfy.\n\n\nIn CS1010 (followed by CS2040C and CS3230), you will learn how to solve computational problems \ncomputationally\n -- this means that you learn to come up with step-by-step instructions meant for computers that you can translate into computer programs, to solve a given problem. \n\n\nExample: Finding the maximum\n\n\nLet's start with a simple problem.  Given a finite list \nL\nL\n of \nk\nk\n integers (\nk\nk\n > 0), find the integer with the maximum value from the list.\n\n\nFirst, let's consider if this is a computational problem.  The input is very well defined.  We know what an integer is.  We are told we have at least one, and we have a finite number of them\n2\n.\n\n\nSecond, let's consider the output.  What conditions must the output satisfy?  First, it has to be equal or larger than every other integer on the list.  Second, it must be an integer \nin\n the list.  This is well defined by the problem statement, so we can say that it is a computational problem.\n\n\nHere is an example.  Suppose the input consists of:\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8\n\n\nThe output should be \n9\n.\n\n\nNow, you should pause reading and think about how you would solve this step-by-step.  \n\n\nAlgorithm\n\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to check through the integers in the list, one-by-one, and keep track of the maximum value so far.  When you reach the end of the list, your \"maximum value so far\" will also be the maximum for the whole list.  \n\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegers Scanned\n\n\nMaximum So Far\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9 3\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe English description above, however, is not detailed enough for computers to understand.  What is the meaning of \"check one-by-one\"? \"keep track of maximum so far\"?  how to tell if we have reached \"the end of the list\"?\n\n\nLet's work out all the details.\n\n\nFirst, we need a concise way of representing the integers in the list.  Borrowing from mathematical notation, let's say that the list \nL\nL\n contains the integers \n\nl_0, l_1, ..., l_{k-1}\nl_0, l_1, ..., l_{k-1}\n. To \"check one-by-one,\" we introduce another notation \nl_i\nl_i\n, which is the integer currently being \"checked\".  We begin with \ni = 0\ni = 0\n, then \ni = 1\ni = 1\n, then \ni = 2\ni = 2\n, etc, until \ni = k-1\ni = k-1\n.  At every step, we increase \ni\ni\n by 1.\n\n\nSecond, we need a concise way of keeping track of the maximum so far.  We introduce another notation, \nm\nm\n, to represent the maximum value so far.  When \ni = 0\ni = 0\n, \nm = l_0\nm = l_0\n.  Since we only scan a single integer, it has to be the maximum.  When we check another integer \nl_i (i > 0)\nl_i (i > 0)\n, only two things can happen:\n\n\n\n\nif this \nl_i\nl_i\n is larger than \nm\nm\n, then \nl_i\nl_i\n has to be the maximum so far, so we update \nm\nm\n to be \nl_i\nl_i\n.\n\n\nif \nl_i\nl_i\n is equal to or smaller than \nm\nm\n, then \nm\nm\n is still the maximum value so far.\n\n\n\n\nWe keep doing the above and increase \ni\ni\n, until we reach the end of the list when (after increasing \ni\ni\n) we find that \ni\ni\n is \nk\nk\n.\n\n\nNow, we have enough details to describe step-by-step, how to find the maximum value from a list of integers.  Such steps, which the computer can take to solve a problem, is called an \nalgorithm\n.  \n\n\nFlowchart\n\n\nThere are different ways one can describe an algorithm.  The easiest way I find is to use a diagram called a \nflowchart\n.  The flowchart for the algorithm above looks like this.  A diamond box represents a \"question\" that can be true or false (yes or no), and we trace through the \"flow\" step by step, following the corresponding path depending on the answer. \n\n\n\n\nPlease spend some time to trace through the walkthrough above.  The snapshot of the values of the \ni\ni\n, \nl_i\nl_i\n, \nk\nk\n, and \nm\nm\n, at the point after \"is \ni\ni\n equals \nk\nk\n\" is shown in the table below (except for the first row, which shows the value just before entering \"is \ni\ni\n equals \nk\nk\n.\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegers Scanned\n\n\ni\ni\n\n\nl_i\nl_i\n\n\nk\nk\n\n\nMaximum So Far (\nm\nm\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n9\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n9\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4\n\n\n2\n\n\n-4\n\n\n9\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0\n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n9\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9\n\n\n4\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9\n\n\n5\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9 3\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5\n\n\n7\n\n\n5\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8\n\n\n8\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8\n\n\n9\n\n\n``\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nThere are a few important things to take note here.  \nm\nm\n, \ni\ni\n, \nk\nk\n, and the list \nL\nL\n are what we called \nstates\n or \nvariables\n.  While in the above, we can think of them as mathematical variables which we can assign \nvalues\n to, in a computer program, a variable is a location in the memory which holds a value.  \n\n\nWe can perform two very basic operations on the variables: reading and writing.  In other words, we can set their values and we can retrieve their values. \n\n\nWe can \nassign\n the value of one variable to a constant (e.g., set \ni\ni\n to 1) or to the value of another variable (e.g., set \nm\nm\n to \nl_i\nl_i\n).  In the latter example, we first read the value of \nl_i\nl_i\n, from \nl_i\nl_i\n's memory location and then we write that value to the memory location of \nm\nm\n.  Once written, the value of \nm\nm\n will not change until the next time we update the value of \nm\nm\n.\n\n\nIt is important to note that, when \ni\ni\n changes, \nm\nm\n \ndoes not change automatically\n to the new \nl_i\nl_i\n  This behavior is different from that which you may be familiar with in spreadsheet software -- if you set the value of a cell, say \nA1\n to be \n=B1\n, when the value in cell \nB1\n changes, the value \nA1\n also changes automatically.\n\n\nWe can also compare the values of two variables.  We see two examples above: \"\ni\ni\n equals \nk\nk\n?\"  \"\nl_i > m\nl_i > m\n?\"  When we compare, we read the values of the variables from their memory location and checks their relations.\n\n\nWe can perform arithmetic operations on the variables: addition, subtraction, etc.  We see one example above: \"increment \ni\ni\n\".  This operation is actually an assignment operation in disguise.  We can write it as \"set \ni\ni\n to \ni\ni\n + 1\".  Here, you see that \ni\ni\n is referred to twice.  This operation reads the value from the memory location of \ni\ni\n, adds 1 to it, and then writes the resulting value back to the location of \ni\ni\n.\n\n\nBugs\n\n\nIf you follow the execution of the algorithm above, step-by-step, using the example input \n4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5\n above, you will obtain the correct maximum value \nm\nm\n of \n9\n.  But does that mean that the algorithm is correct?  The answer is NO.  \n\n\nFor an algorithm to correctly solve the given problem, it has to produce the correct result for all valid inputs to the problem.  If we can find one counterexample, one input where the algorithm does not produce the correct output, then the algorithm is incorrect.  Note that I say \ndoes not produce the correct output\n, which means that either the algorithm  \nproduces the wrong output\n or \ndoes not produce any output at all\n.  \n\n\nIn this case, we say that the algorithm or the program has a \nbug\n.  A bug is a defect that causes the algorithm to behave incorrectly.  As a software developer, you will spend some time finding bugs in your code, a process known as \ndebugging\n.  A \ndebugger\n is a tool that helps programmers find bugs in their code.\n\n\nBefore we even start the process of debugging, we first have to know if our algorithm is correct.  Remember that an algorithm is correct only if it produces the correct output only all possible valid inputs.  So, one way to check if an algorithm is correct is to try it with all possible valid inputs.  For the problem we are solving above, however, even though the list is finite, there are infinitely many possible inputs, and so, it is impossible to try all possible valid inputs.  In practice, we \ncraft\n a smaller set of test inputs to check if the algorithm behaves correctly for these test inputs, and \nhope\n that it is correct for all possible inputs.  With experience, you will choose the right set of test inputs to maximize that chances that you will find a bug in your code.  There are also systematic ways of deriving test cases so that the test cases \ncover\n different paths of execution of the algorithm, but we won't be covering it in CS1010\n3\n.\n\n\nAnother way of checking if an algorithm is correct, is to reason about the behavior of the algorithm.  We will do this rather informally in CS1010, starting in 1-2 lectures from now.  You get to rigorously prove that an algorithm is correct in a higher level module (CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms).\n\n\nFinally, even if an algorithm is correct, the corresponding program might not be.  Recall that an algorithm is a step-by-step process to solve a problem.  It is what you want your program to do.  You still have to write a program (in C, or other languages) to actually have the computer do what you want it to do (in other words, to \nimplement the algorithm\n). This process of translating the algorithm to a computer program, called \ncoding\n may introduce bugs as well.  But we will worry about this later when we learn to program.\n\n\nIn the problem set at the end of this lecture, you will see slight variations of the algorithm above.

A computational problem is a problem that can be solved step-by-step with a computer.  These problems usually have a well-defined input, constraints, and conditions that the output must satisfied.  Here are some types of computational problems:    A  decision problem  is one where the answer is yes or no.  For instance, \"given a number  n , is  n  even?\" is a decision problem.  Some decision problems take more steps to solve than others.  For instance, \"given a number  n , is  n  prime?\" takes more steps than just checking the parity of a number.    A  search problem  is one where the solution consists of one or more values that satisfies a given condition.  For instance, we may want to compute a path from one geographical location to another on a map.    A  counting problem  is one where the answer is the number of solutions to a search problem.    An  optimization problem  is one where the solution is the \"best\" possible solution, where the \"best\" can be defined in a different way.  For instance, we may want to compute the fastest route from one location to another.    Questions such as \"what is the meaning of life?\" \"do I look good in this outfit?\" 1  are not computational problems, because they do not have well-defined input, constraints, and conditions that the output must satisfy.  In CS1010 (followed by CS2040C and CS3230), you will learn how to solve computational problems  computationally  -- this means that you learn to come up with step-by-step instructions meant for computers that you can translate into computer programs, to solve a given problem.",

Second, let's consider the output.  What conditions must the output satisfy?  First, it has to be equal or larger than every other integer on the list.  Second, it must be an integer  in  the list.  This is well defined by the problem statement, so we can say that it is a computational problem.  Here is an example.  Suppose the input consists of:  4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8  The output should be  9 .

When you reach the end of the list, your \"maximum value so far\" will also be the maximum for the whole list.    Let's look at an example:     Integers Scanned  Maximum So Far      4  4    4 1  4    4 1 -4  4    4 1 -4 0  4    4 1 -4 0 9  9    4 1 -4 0 9 9  9    4 1 -4 0 9 9 3  9    4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5  9    4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8  9     The English description above, however, is not detailed enough for computers to understand.  What is the meaning of \"check one-by-one\"? \"keep track of maximum so far\"?  how to tell if we have reached \"the end of the list\"?  Let's work out all the details.  First, we need a concise way of representing the integers in the list.  Borrowing from mathematical notation, let's say that the list  L L  contains the integers  l_0, l_1, ..., l_{k-1} l_0, l_1, ..., l_{k-1} . To \"check one-by-one,\" we introduce another notation  l_i l_i , which is the integer currently being \"checked\".  We begin with  i = 0 i = 0 , then  i = 1 i = 1 , then  i = 2 i = 2 , etc, until  i = k-1 i = k-1 .  At every step, we increase  i i  by 1.  Second, we need a concise way of keeping track of the maximum so far.  We introduce another notation,  m m , to represent the maximum value so far.  When  i = 0 i = 0 ,  m = l_0 m = l_0 .  Since we only scan a single integer, it has to be the maximum.  When we check another integer  l_i (i > 0) l_i (i > 0) , only two things can happen:   if this  l_i l_i  is larger than  m m , then  l_i l_i  has to be the maximum so far, so we update  m m  to be  l_i l_i .  if  l_i l_i  is equal to or smaller than  m m , then  m m  is still the maximum value so far.   We keep doing the above and increase  i i , until we reach the end of the list when (after increasing  i i ) we find that  i i  is  k k .  Now, we have enough details to describe step-by-step, how to find the maximum value from a list of integers.  Such steps, which the computer can take to solve a problem, is called an  algorithm .",

            "text": "There are a few important things to take note here.   m m ,  i i ,  k k , and the list  L L  are what we called  states  or  variables .  While in the above, we can think of them as mathematical variables which we can assign  values  to, in a computer program, a variable is a location in the memory which holds a value.    We can perform two very basic operations on the variables: reading and writing.  In other words, we can set their values and we can retrieve their values.   We can  assign  the value of one variable to a constant (e.g., set  i i  to 1) or to the value of another variable (e.g., set  m m  to  l_i l_i ).  In the latter example, we first read the value of  l_i l_i , from  l_i l_i 's memory location and then we write that value to the memory location of  m m .  Once written, the value of  m m  will not change until the next time we update the value of  m m .  It is important to note that, when  i i  changes,  m m   does not change automatically  to the new  l_i l_i   This behavior is different from that which you may be familiar with in spreadsheet software -- if you set the value of a cell, say  A1  to be  =B1 , when the value in cell  B1  changes, the value  A1  also changes automatically.  We can also compare the values of two variables.  We see two examples above: \" i i  equals  k k ?\"  \" l_i > m l_i > m ?\"  When we compare, we read the values of the variables from their memory location and checks their relations.  We can perform arithmetic operations on the variables: addition, subtraction, etc.  We see one example above: \"increment  i i \".  This operation is actually an assignment operation in disguise.  We can write it as \"set  i i  to  i i  + 1\".  Here, you see that  i i  is referred to twice.  This operation reads the value from the memory location of  i i , adds 1 to it, and then writes the resulting value back to the location of  i i .",

But does that mean that the algorithm is correct?  The answer is NO.    For an algorithm to correctly solve the given problem, it has to produce the correct result for all valid inputs to the problem.  If we can find one counterexample, one input where the algorithm does not produce the correct output, then the algorithm is incorrect.  Note that I say  does not produce the correct output , which means that either the algorithm   produces the wrong output  or  does not produce any output at all .    In this case, we say that the algorithm or the program has a  bug .  A bug is a defect that causes the algorithm to behave incorrectly.  As a software developer, you will spend some time finding bugs in your code, a process known as  debugging .  A  debugger  is a tool that helps programmers find bugs in their code.  Before we even start the process of debugging, we first have to know if our algorithm is correct.  Remember that an algorithm is correct only if it produces the correct output only all possible valid inputs.  So, one way to check if an algorithm is correct is to try it with all possible valid inputs.  For the problem we are solving above, however, even though the list is finite, there are infinitely many possible inputs, and so, it is impossible to try all possible valid inputs.  In practice, we  craft  a smaller set of test inputs to check if the algorithm behaves correctly for these test inputs, and  hope  that it is correct for all possible inputs.  With experience, you will choose the right set of test inputs to maximize that chances that you will find a bug in your code.  There are also systematic ways of deriving test cases so that the test cases  cover  different paths of execution of the algorithm, but we won't be covering it in CS1010 3 .  Another way of checking if an algorithm is correct, is to reason about the behavior of the algorithm.  We will do this rather informally in CS1010, starting in 1-2 lectures from now.  You get to rigorously prove that an algorithm is correct in a higher level module (CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms).  Finally, even if an algorithm is correct, the corresponding program might not be.  Recall that an algorithm is a step-by-step process to solve a problem.  It is what you want your program to do.  You still have to write a program (in C, or other languages) to actually have the computer do what you want it to do (in other words, to  implement the algorithm ). This process of translating the algorithm to a computer program, called  coding  may introduce bugs as well.  But we will worry about this later when we learn to program.  In the problem set at the end of this lecture, you will see slight variations of the algorithm above.  You should check through them to see whether they are correct or not.",
